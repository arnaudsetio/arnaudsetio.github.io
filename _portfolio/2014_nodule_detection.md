Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Currently, only 15% of all diagnosed lung cancers are detected at an early stage, which causes a five-year survival rate of only 16%. The aim of this project is to automatically detect cancers in an earlier stage when curative treatment options are better.

Within this project, novel Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems for pulmonary nodules were developed and evaluated. The results were presented through a number of publications listed below and summarized in my [PhD Thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/psqn80ez225ir7l/thesis_arnaud.pdf?dl=0).
